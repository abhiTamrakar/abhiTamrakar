- 👋 Hi, I’m @abhiTamrakar, feel free to call me AT.
- 👀 I’m interested in opensource projects that make life easy for everyone, devops tools, golang, python and linux based developments.
- 🌱 You can check my work in some of the repositories here. I’m currently learning golang advanced and looking forward to learn R next.
- 💞️ I can collaborate on any opensource project based on python or golang or with people who need any help in learning or suggestions on DevOps roadmap.
